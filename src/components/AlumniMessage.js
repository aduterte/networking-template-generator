            <p><b>Greetings from a fellow Flatiron Alumni</b></p>
            <p>Hi {contact}</p>
            <p>I hope all is well with you.  I noticed that you attended Flatiron School and began your new journey as a developer at {company}.  As a recent Flatiron School graduate, I would love to know more about your post-graduation experience and how you successfully transition into the industry.</p>
            <p>Would you be open to scheduling a virtual coffee meeting to discuss your experience?  If so, please let me know what date and time work best for you.  If your schedule doesnâ€™t permit us to connect, would you be open to answering a few questions via email?</p>
            <p>I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Thanks in advance!</p>
            <p>Best,
            <br/>
